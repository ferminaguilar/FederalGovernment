# How to Contribute to UX

The UX team welcomes contributors with 2+ years of UX and Drupal experience who can commit to ongoing involvement in improving the AI ecosystem.

Contributors join weekly UX meetings and take on work between check-ins.

**There are two main ways to get involved:**

## Support UX Requests

Help triage and respond to [UX review requests](./request_ux_support.md) from the community. This involves assessing incoming issues, providing feedback on naming and labeling, and reviewing interfaces against established [AI UX Principles](./core_ux_principles.md).

Contributors in this role support one or more UX requests per week. New contributors receive onboarding to the team's principles and workflows.

## Join a UX Project Team

Work on planned UX initiatives as part of the AI Makers program. Project teams need researchers, designers, developers, and QA testers. This is a great way to have a larger impact on the ecosystem.

Contributors in this role take on regular project work between weekly meetings.

To get started, introduce yourself in the **#ai-ux** channel on [Drupal Slack](https://www.drupal.org/slack) and let us know what you're interested in. A product/project owner will work with you to find a UX project that matches your skills.
