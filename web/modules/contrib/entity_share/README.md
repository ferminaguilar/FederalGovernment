# Entity Share

## Introduction

This module allows to share entities using the JSON:API. It provides a UI to
use the endpoints provided by the JSON:API module.

You can define one website as a "server" and another website as a "client". A
website can be both "client" and "server".

See also the documentation pages:
* [Supported field types](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/entity-share/supported-field-types)
* [Advanced usages](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/entity-share/advanced-usages)

## Requirements

This module requires the following module:
* JSON:API (Core)

The following core patch is needed for code-defined bundle fields to work:

* ContentEntityDenormalizer uses the field map, and so is unaware of bundle
  fields: https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3522951

### Requirements for specific processor plugins

* The redirect processor requires:
  * The [Redirect module](https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect)
  * The patch to the Redirect module at
    https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect/issues/3057679 is recommended, to
    allow the user authenticated on the server to view redirect entities without
    having access to manage them.

## Recommended modules and patches

* [JSON:API Extras](https://www.drupal.org/project/jsonapi_extras):
  To allow to customize the JSON:API endpoints and to enable full pager
  feature. See the documentation page
  [Supported field types](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-modules/entity-share/supported-field-types).
* [Views Bulk Operations](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations):
  To allow to update the import policy without having to reimport entities.
* [Menu Link Content View Access](https://www.drupal.org/project/menu_link_content_view_access)
  To allow view access to the entity share role, so that menu link content
  entities can be pulled.

The following patches may be of some use:

* Paragraph entities can't be pulled directly from a channel because they can't
  be filtered in JSON:API:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/3097493
* The same for Paragraph Library entities:
  https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs/issues/3228913

## Installation

* Install and enable the Entity Share Server on the site you want to get
  content from.
